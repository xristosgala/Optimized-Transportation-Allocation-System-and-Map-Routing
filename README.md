Overview:
This system implements a Transportation Allocation Problem using Linear Programming (LP) to optimize the transportation of goods while minimizing costs.
It incorporates multiple constraints such as supply limits, demand satisfaction, driver hours, and capacity limits, all to ensure that the transportation system runs efficiently.
The problem is solved using PuLP (a Python library for LP problems) and results are visualized using Streamlit for an interactive web-based experience.
Additionally, the solution includes route mapping for visualizing supply-demand connections and driver routes.
